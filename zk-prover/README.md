# ZK Human Typing Prover

This Rust crate provides Zero-Knowledge proof generation for human typing verification. It compiles to WebAssembly (WASM) and integrates with the AbroOS application to verify that content was typed by a human rather than generated by AI.

## Features

- Keystroke pattern analysis
- Zero-Knowledge proof generation
- On-chain verification

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)

### Building

```bash
wasm-pack build --target web
```

Or use the provided build script from the root directory:

```bash
yarn build:zk-prover
```

## Integration with Next.js

The Rust code is compiled to WebAssembly and integrated with the Next.js application through the API routes in `app/api/zk-prover/`. The TypeScript interface is defined in `lib/zk-prover-init.ts`.

## API Reference

### ZKProver

The main class for interacting with the ZK prover.

#### Methods

- `collect_keystroke_patterns(keystroke_deltas: number[]): KeystrokePattern`
- `generate_human_typing_proof(content: string, keystroke_pattern: KeystrokePattern): ZKProof`
- `verify_proof_on_chain(zk_proof: ZKProof): { verified: boolean, txHash: string }`
