# Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Framework for abroOs

This directory contains a simulated Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework for the abroOs web-based desktop environment. The implementation is designed to demonstrate how TEEs work and how they can be used to provide secure computing environments for sensitive data processing.

## Overview

The TEE framework implements a simulated version of hardware-backed secure processing environments. It includes:

- **Trusted Application Management**: Secure registration, verification, and lifecycle management of Trusted Applications
- **Secure Storage**: Isolated storage mechanisms that prevent access to data from unauthorized applications
- **TEE Manager**: Core management functionality for the TEE environment, including attestation
- **React Integration**: Components and hooks to easily integrate TEE functionality into React applications

## Core Components

### Trusted Application Framework (`trusted-application.ts`)

Defines the interfaces and classes for Trusted Applications (TAs) and provides a registry for managing them. Key features:

- Application signature verification
- Permission-based access control
- Application lifecycle management (install, start, stop)
- Event-based notifications

### Secure Storage (`secure-storage.ts`)

Provides an isolated storage mechanism for Trusted Applications. Key features:

- Application-specific data isolation
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Access control based on application identity
- Web Crypto API integration

### TEE Manager (`tee-manager.ts`)

Core management functionality for the TEE. Key features:

- TEE activation and deactivation
- Attestation simulation
- Event history tracking
- Security state management

### TEE Context (`tee-context.tsx`)

React context and hooks for integrating TEE functionality into React applications. Key features:

- React context for TEE state
- Hooks for using TEE functionality in components
- Higher-order component for Trusted Applications
- Event handling and state management

## Visual Components

### Trust Zone Indicator (`TrustZoneIndicator.tsx`)

Visual indicators for TEE status and Trusted Applications. Components:

- `TrustZoneIndicator`: Global indicator for active TEE
- `TrustZoneLocalIndicator`: Local indicator for components using TEE
- `TrustZoneContainer`: Container with visual cues for TEE-protected content
- `RequiresTeeWarning`: Warning component when TEE is required but not active

## Sample Applications

### Secure Wallet (`SecureWalletApp.tsx`)

Demonstrates secure key management within a TEE. Features:

- Private key protection using TEE
- Secure wallet creation and management
- Isolation from the rest of the system

### Secure Computation (`SecureComputationApp.tsx`)

Demonstrates privacy-preserving multi-party computation. Features:

- Simulated homomorphic encryption for private data
- Secure processing of sensitive information
- Results without revealing inputs

## Usage

To use the TEE framework in an application:

1. Wrap your application with the `TeeProvider`
2. Define your Trusted Application
3. Use the `useTee` hook to access TEE functionality
4. Register and start your Trusted Application
5. Use the TEE's secure storage for sensitive data

Example:

```tsx
// Define your Trusted Application
const mySecureApp: TrustedApplication = {
  id: 'my-secure-app',
  name: 'My Secure App',
  // ...other properties
};

// Use in a component
function MySecureComponent() {
  const { isActive, registerTrustedApp, startTrustedApp, secureStorage } = useTee();
  
  // Register and start the app
  useEffect(() => {
    registerTrustedApp(mySecureApp);
    if (isActive) {
      startTrustedApp(mySecureApp.id);
    }
  }, [isActive]);
  
  // Use secure storage
  const storeSecretData = async (data) => {
    await secureStorage.store('secret_key', data, mySecureApp.id);
  };
  
  // ...rest of component
}
```

## Integration with abroOs

The TEE framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with the abroOs web-based desktop environment. It provides an additional layer of security for applications handling sensitive data, such as wallets, financial applications, or identity verification tools.

## Security Considerations

This implementation is a simulation of TEE concepts for educational purposes. In a real TEE:

- Hardware-backed security features would be used
- Cryptographic attestation would verify the TEE's integrity
- Secure boot would ensure the integrity of the TEE
- The TEE would be isolated from the regular execution environment at the hardware level
