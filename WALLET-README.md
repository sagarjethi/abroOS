# Ethereum Wallet Chat Integration

This implementation demonstrates the integration of an AI-powered Ethereum wallet assistant that provides interactive help and wallet functionality.

## Features

- Interactive chat interface for wallet assistance
- Function calling to retrieve wallet information
- Support for common wallet operations
- Quick action buttons for frequent questions
- Educational content about blockchain concepts

## Components

### API Route

The wallet chat API route is located at `app/api/agent/route.ts`. It provides:

- OpenAI GPT-4o integration with function calling
- Simulated wallet operations for demonstration
- Streaming responses for real-time interaction

### Wallet App Component

The wallet component in `components/wallet/WalletApp.tsx` includes:

- Chat interface with AI-powered assistant
- Wallet management features
- Transaction history
- Token management
- Quick action buttons

## Flow Diagram

```
User Query → API Route → OpenAI → Function Call → Wallet Operations → Response

## Implementation Notes

1. **Wallet Context**: Uses the existing wallet context to manage wallet state and operations
2. **Chat Integration**: Uses the AI SDK for chat functionality
3. **Tool Definitions**: Custom tools defined for wallet operations
4. **Simulated Data**: Currently uses simulated data for demonstration purposes

## Future Enhancements

- Connect to real blockchain data using AgentKit
- Add support for multi-chain operations
- Integrate DeFi protocol interactions
- Improve token discovery and management
- Add transaction simulation before execution

## Usage Examples

### Check Balance

Ask the assistant: "What's my current balance?"

### Send Transaction

Ask the assistant: "How do I send ETH to 0x123...?"

### Learn About Gas

Ask the assistant: "What are gas fees and how do they work?"

### Token Swaps

Ask the assistant: "How can I swap ETH for USDC?"

## Security Considerations

- Never share your private keys or seed phrases
- Always verify transaction details before signing
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
- Use hardware wallets for large holdings
