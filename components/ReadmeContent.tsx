## Overview

abroOs is an interactive, web-based desktop operating system environment built as a portfolio project, drawing inspiration from Dustin Brett's daedalOS as well as LinuxOnTheWeb. It demonstrates a wide range of frontend and systems programming skills, focusing on a blend of user experience, scalability, and optimization. The goal is to emulate desktop-like functionality, providing a platform where users can interact with applications, files, and features within a web browser.

## Features

- üíª Full desktop environment with window management
- ü™ü Draggable, resizable, and focusable windows
- üìÅ File system with create, rename, delete operations
- üñ±Ô∏è Context menus for desktop and files
- üì± Responsive design that works across devices
- üîÑ Persistent state with localStorage and Origin Private File System
- ‚öôÔ∏è System applications including:
  - File Explorer
  - Text Editor
  - Weather App
  - Calculator
  - Calendar
  - Memory Game
  - Browser
  - Code Indexer

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed, good for scalable and maintainable code
- **React/Next.js**: For dynamic rendering and routing
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library built on Radix UI
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design
- **Framer Motion**: For fluid animations and transitions
- **Lucide React**: For consistent iconography
- **LocalStorage/OPFS**: For data persistence

## Architecture

The application is built using a component-based architecture with React:

- **Window Management**: Managed through the WindowsContext
- **File System**: Implemented with the FileSystemContext
- **Desktop Environment**: Handles icon display and interaction
- **Applications**: Standalone components that run within windows

## Technical Highlights

- **React Context API**: Used for global state management (windows, file system)
- **Custom Hooks**: For functionality like drag and drop, context menus, and window focus
- **LocalStorage/OPFS Integration**: For persistent file storage
- **Dynamic Component Loading**: For efficient application rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- **Tailwind CSS**: For consistent and maintainable styling
