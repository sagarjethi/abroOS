# 0G Network Integration Guide

![0G Network Integration](https://example.com/0g-integration.png)

## Introduction

This document provides an overview of how the abroOs environment integrates with the 0G Network for decentralized storage and compute services. The integration is seamless and user-friendly, requiring minimal setup while providing powerful capabilities.

## 0G Network Overview

The 0G Network is a decentralized infrastructure platform that offers:

1. **0G Storage** - Decentralized file storage with blockchain-based verification
2. **0G Compute** - Distributed computing resources for AI, rendering, and data processing

All services on the 0G Network operate using the A0GI token for payments, with testnet tokens available for development.

## Integration Components

### 1. Wallet System

The wallet system in abroOs serves as the foundation for 0G integration:

- **Account Creation** - Generate new wallets or import existing ones
- **Network Management** - Switch to 0G Testnet for service access
- **Transaction Handling** - Process payments for 0G services
- **Balance Tracking** - Monitor A0GI token balances
- **Security** - Encrypted storage for private keys and sensitive data

### 2. 0G Storage Application

The 0G Storage app provides a full-featured interface to the 0G decentralized storage network:

- **File Upload** - Upload files to the 0G network with transparent fee display
- **File Management** - Browse, download, and organize your stored files
- **Transaction Monitoring** - Track storage transactions and view on block explorer
- **Network Status** - View 0G network health and connection status
- **Fee Calculation** - Preview storage fees before committing to uploads

### 3. 0G Compute Window

The 0G Compute window offers access to powerful distributed computing resources:

- **API Key Management** - Securely store and manage your 0G Compute API keys
- **Service Selection** - Choose from available compute services based on your needs
- **Interactive Interface** - Chat-based interaction with compute services
- **Response History** - Track and reference previous compute responses
- **Settings Configuration** - Customize your compute environment

## Technical Implementation

### Wallet Integration

The wallet integration uses several key components:

```typescript
// Wallet accessor singleton
const walletAccessor = new WalletAccessor();

// Connect to 0G Testnet
evmWalletService.setNetwork('zerogtestnet');

// Create and manage wallet
const wallet = await evmWalletService.createWallet(password);

// Sign transactions for 0G Services
const signer = walletAccessor.getWallet();
```

### 0G Storage Implementation

The 0G Storage application uses the 0G SDK to interact with the network:

```typescript
// Import 0G SDK components
import { Blob, Indexer } from '@0glabs/0g-ts-sdk';

// Upload process
const indexer = new Indexer(storageRpc);
await indexer.upload(blob, l1Rpc, signer, uploadOptions);

// Download process
const blob = await indexer.download(rootHash);
```

### 0G Compute Implementation

The 0G Compute service connects via API:

```typescript
// Set API key for compute services
zeroGCompute.setApiKey(apiKey);

// List available services
const services = await zeroGCompute.listServices();

// Send compute query
const response = await zeroGCompute.sendQuery(prompt);
```

## User Experience

The integration provides a seamless user experience:

1. **One-Click Access** - Desktop icons for direct access to 0G services
2. **Guided Setup** - Step-by-step wallet setup for new users
3. **Visual Progress** - Progress indicators for uploads and downloads
4. **Fee Transparency** - Clear display of costs before transactions
5. **Responsive Design** - Adaptive interface works across devices

## Security Considerations

The 0G integration implements several security measures:

- **Encrypted Storage** - Wallet private keys are encrypted with AES-256
- **Local Processing** - Sensitive data never leaves the user's device
- **Secure API Keys** - API keys stored with encryption
- **Transaction Verification** - Clear confirmation steps before sending transactions
- **Network Status** - Monitoring of network health to prevent failed transactions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
- 0G Testnet account (for full functionality)
- 0G Compute API key (for compute services)

### Quick Start

1. Launch abroOs desktop environment
2. Click on "Ethereum Wallet" icon to create or import a wallet
3. Switch to 0G Testnet network
4. Access 0G Storage or 0G Compute from desktop icons
5. Follow in-app instructions for service-specific setup

## Development

For developers looking to extend the 0G integration:

### Required Dependencies

```bash
# Install 0G SDK
npm install @0glabs/0g-ts-sdk

# Install Ethers.js for wallet functionality
npm install ethers
```
